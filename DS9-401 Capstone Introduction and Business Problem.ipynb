    "## Introduction\n",
    "Finding a place to rent in Toronto is a painful process where rental unit availability can change in an hour. As a result tenants often feel pressured into making quick decisions that they might come to regret. There are a few factors impacting the decision: price, state of the unit, en-suite equipment, building amenities, number of washrooms, square footage, whether the unit is furnished, roommates if any, neighbors, proximity to public transit, garage or other parking facilities, unique factors such as pet ownership to name a few. All the mentioned factors can be grouped into categories: financial, unit-related, location-related, and personal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the choices for the factors can be stated explicitly and are already embedded in the search functionality  of major rental search websites. It's quite simple, really, to input how many bedrooms you as a tenant want, what your budget is, whether you will ever use the condo gym (aka do you care about amenities), do you need the unit furnished, whether you have pets, etc. And you have a list of available units. The question that comes unnoticed is the location. The net cast is either too wide or too narrow, rarely right. Yes, you do know how long you want to commute but what if the perfect neighborhood is just 5 min further? As you might have guessed, we will try to address this issue in the report. We will attempt to build a recommended list of neighborhoods."

    "## Target Audience and Impact Analysis\n",
    "Stakeholder groups of this report are the rental market participants in Toronto. This problem is especially acute for tenants and rental brokers. It will also indirectly impact landlords because if solved could potentially decrease the churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tenants\n",
    "Tenants the main target audience of the report. They are the buyers in the market and have to define their preferences before hitting the search button. The first preference is the location. There are two potential variants of the problem: being too general with the location preferences and being too specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tenant is being too general, it might take a lot of time to narrow down or the decision will simply be made on the price, saving the budget but potentially making the life not as enjoyable. But if there is the shortlist of neighborhoods for the tenant to choose from, the trial-and-error process of looking for the right location can be streamlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the tenant is too specific, they might miss the perfect unit simply because it is 500 meters further from the designated area. In this case the shortlist might expand the number of quality units for the tenant to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rental brokers\n",
    "The shortlist of neighborhoods for the tenant to choose from can provide a competitive advantage over the market, make the search process more efficient, increase the broker's capacity to service more clients, close more deals as the recommendations will make intuitive sense to the tenant, and finally happier customers that can spread the word through the grapevine increasing the number of prospects and making the business more sustainable in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Landlords\n",
    "If the tenants are satisfied with all the factors feeding their decision, they are more likely to rent long-term barring any major life-altering events (marriage, kids, relocation for work). If the unit gets the new market price it might get an additional 1000 CAD/year but at a cost of a hassle of showings, background checks, negotiations, adjustments to the new tenants and a risk of the vacancy for a month which will undercut any benefits of taking the new market price. In addition, happy tenants means less complaints and less hassle long term."

Many factors can play a role but the decision is very binary: one either enjoys the neighborhood or does not. This project will aim to help answer the tenant's question: will I enjoy this neighborhood by providing a recommended shortlist of neighborhoods to explore. "
